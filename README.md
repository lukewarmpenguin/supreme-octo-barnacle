Attempt at a one button contraction timer pinned app for my wife. Vibe coded by a great prompter and terrible coder

Here's what ChatGPT churched that up to say:

🐧 Nestling Contraction Counter

A retro-futuristic contraction tracker built for calm, clarity, and countdowns.

Purpose:
Nestling Contraction Counter is a simple, one-touch contraction timer designed to make labor tracking stress-free.
It alternates between contraction and rest periods, automatically calculating the 5-1-1 rule:

Contractions lasting 1 minute, occurring every 5 minutes, for 1 hour.

When this threshold is reached, the app lights up with a celebratory “BABY INCOMING!” alert — complete with glowing klaxons and confetti fireworks.

💡 Features
	•	One-button Contraction / Rest toggle
	•	Automatic 5-1-1 detection with visual and haptic alerts
	•	Confetti and neon animation for milestones
	•	Tracks and displays Start, Duration, Rest, and Cycle times
	•	CSV export for medical or personal records
	•	Works offline as a Progressive Web App (PWA)
	•	Styled in a retro-futuristic neon aesthetic — the signature Lukewarmpenguin vibe

⸻

🧠 How It Works
	1.	Tap Start Contraction to begin timing.
	2.	Tap again when the contraction ends — this begins the rest period.
	3.	Tap again when the next contraction begins — this ends the rest phase and starts a new cycle.
	4.	The app averages contractions and rest periods over the last hour; when the average cycle hits 5-1-1, you’ll know it’s time.

🧰 Tech Stack
	•	HTML / CSS / JavaScript
	•	Tailwind for layout
	•	Confetti.js for celebration effects
	•	PWA-ready for mobile install

👶 A note from the dev

“I wanted a contraction tracker that would help me focus on my wife, not my stopwatch.
Nestling keeps things simple, bright, and a little bit fun — just like the moments leading up to meeting our baby penguin.”
